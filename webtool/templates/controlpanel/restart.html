            <p>Use the buttons below to restart or upgrade 4CAT. Restarting will stop and start the backend daemon and
                attempt to trigger a restart of the web interface.</p>

            <p>Upgrading will pull the latest release from the 4CAT GitHub repository (you can configure a different URL
                in the 4CAT settings). If the release is newer than the code currently running, it will be installed and
                4CAT will be upgraded to the newest version. Afterwards 4CAT will be restarted and if necessary the
                relevant upgrade scripts will be run with default settings.</p>

            <p>Restarting is relatively safe, upgrading always has a risk of breaking things. The web interface may be
                unresponsive during the process. You can read the process log below. Don't upgrade on Friday
                afternoons :-)</p>

            <p>You are currently running 4CAT version <code>{{ current_version }}</code>.<br>
                The latest release available is <code>{{ tagged_version }}</code>.</p>

            <p>{% if can_upgrade %}You can upgrade 4CAT.{% else %}No upgrades are currently available.{% endif %}</p>
